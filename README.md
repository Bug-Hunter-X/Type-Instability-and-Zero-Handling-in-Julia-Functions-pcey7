# Julia Code: Type Instability and Zero Handling
This repository contains example Julia code showcasing a common source of performance issues: type instability and incorrect zero handling.  The `bug.jl` file presents the problematic code, while `bugSolution.jl` offers a more efficient and robust solution.  The issue is described in more detail below.

## Problem Description
The original Julia function (`myfunction` in `bug.jl`) uses an `if/else` statement, but this can lead to type instability if not carefully considered.  The result type changes depending on the input value, impacting overall performance, particularly for larger datasets or repeated function calls.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.jl` file introduces improvements to address type instability and zero handling.  The solution demonstrates handling different data types, including potentially missing data, and ensures type stability to enhance performance.

## Running the Code
To run the code, simply save the provided `bug.jl` and `bugSolution.jl` files and execute them using the Julia REPL.
